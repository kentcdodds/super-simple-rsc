# Super Simple React Server Components

**Status: DEPRECATED** This has been turned into a workshop which you can go
through on your own here:
**[epicweb-dev/react-server-components](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/react-server-components)**.
Enjoy!

This is was based originally on React's flight-esm fixture:
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/fixtures/flight-esm

The goal is to reduce the number of external dependencies as much as reasonable
to teach how to RSCs work.
